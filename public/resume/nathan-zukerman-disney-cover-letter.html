        <strong>Hiring Manager</strong><br>
        Disney Entertainment and ESPN Product & Technology<br>
        Lead Product Designer - Ad Platforms Team
    </div>

    <div class="greeting">Dear Hiring Manager,</div>

    <div class="body-text">
        I am writing to express my strong interest in the Lead Product Designer position on Disney's Ad Platforms team. With over 7 years of experience designing enterprise platforms for government agencies, Fortune 500 companies, and startups, I am excited about the opportunity to bring simplicity and craft to Disney's advertising ecosystem while helping shape the future of your streaming business.
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
        What drew me to this role is the challenge of <strong>bringing clarity to complexity</strong> — something that defines both my experience and this position. At Booz Allen Hamilton, I led the redesign of three critical government platforms serving millions of users, including the Department of Transportation's ITS JPO and the NIH/NLM Common Data Elements platform. These projects required me to transform dense, technical workflows into intuitive self-service tools for diverse user groups — from transportation researchers to medical professionals managing complex datasets. This experience directly translates to simplifying campaign planning, audience targeting, and self-service tooling for Disney's advertisers.
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
        My approach combines <strong>deep user research, strategic product thinking, and high-craft execution</strong>. For the FDG Release Calendar at the Treasury Department, I conducted stakeholder interviews across multiple agencies, translated complex scheduling requirements into an elegant interface, and delivered a solution that improved cross-agency coordination. At USAA, I designed a comprehensive icon system and mobile-first financial tools for military families — work that required balancing accessibility, emotional resonance, and technical constraints. These projects demonstrate my ability to solve foggy problems, establish new patterns, and mentor teams through ambiguity.
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
        I am particularly energized by this role's emphasis on <strong>leadership as an individual contributor</strong>. Throughout my career, I have built influential partnerships with engineering and product teams, presented design vision to executive stakeholders, and mentored junior designers. At Booz Allen, I established design standards that elevated work across multiple government contracts. I thrive in environments where I can both ship high-caliber work independently and strengthen the culture and craft of the team around me.
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
        As someone who believes that <strong>great design happens where empathy meets strategy</strong>, I am drawn to Disney's mission of entertaining and inspiring people through storytelling. My creative work in stop-motion animation and sculpting has deepened my understanding of narrative, timing, and emotional impact — skills that inform every pixel I push. I am expert-level in Figma, passionate about leveraging data to inform design decisions, and hungry to challenge conventions in service of business impact.
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
        I would love the opportunity to discuss how my experience simplifying complex enterprise platforms, building design systems, and leading cross-functional initiatives can contribute to Disney's Ad Platforms team. Thank you for considering my application.
    </div>

    <div class="closing">
        <div>Sincerely,</div>
