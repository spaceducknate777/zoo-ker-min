    <div class="recipient">
        <strong>Hiring Manager</strong><br>
        Hasbro<br>
        Product Design Team
    </div>

    <div class="greeting">Dear Hiring Manager,</div>

    <div class="body-text">
        I am excited to apply for the Product Designer position at Hasbro. With over 7 years of experience designing consumer-facing digital products for brands like BMW, Trader Joe's, and USAA, combined with a lifelong passion for creative storytelling through illustration, sculpting, and stop-motion animation, I am energized by the opportunity to help design experiences that bring joy, imagination, and play to families around the world.
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
        What makes me uniquely suited for Hasbro is the intersection of my <strong>consumer product design expertise and hands-on creative practice</strong>. My portfolio includes extensive work in digital illustration, polymer clay sculpting, and stop-motion animation — all forms of storytelling that require understanding character, emotion, and narrative arc. This creative foundation informs how I approach product design: I don't just create interfaces, I craft experiences that resonate emotionally and invite exploration. At Hasbro, where play is the product, this mindset would translate directly to designing digital experiences that capture the magic of your toys and games.
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
        My experience designing for <strong>major consumer brands</strong> has taught me how to balance business goals with delightful user experiences. At BMW, I led the UX design for a vehicle configurator used by millions of potential customers, requiring deep collaboration with stakeholders across multiple countries and rigorous user testing to simplify complex customization flows. For Trader Joe's concept work, I designed a mobile app experience focused on discovery and personality — capturing the brand's quirky, friendly voice in every interaction. At USAA, I designed financial tools for military families, where trust, clarity, and accessibility were paramount. These projects demonstrate my ability to understand diverse audiences and translate brand values into meaningful digital experiences.
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
        I am particularly drawn to Hasbro's mission of <strong>making the world a better place for all children, fans, and families</strong>. My approach to design is grounded in empathy and research. Whether conducting stakeholder interviews for government platforms or observing how users interact with financial tools, I prioritize understanding real needs before jumping to solutions. At Hasbro, I would bring this same rigor to understanding how children and families interact with your digital products — from gaming apps to e-commerce experiences — ensuring that every design decision supports play, learning, and connection.
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
        Beyond my design work, my <strong>creative pursuits reflect the spirit of Hasbro</strong>. My stop-motion animations explore storytelling through movement and character. My sculpting work with polymer clay and Nomad Sculpt (digital 3D sculpting) focuses on bringing imaginative creatures and characters to life. My illustrations range from whimsical to surreal, always exploring narrative and emotion. These projects aren't just hobbies — they're how I stay connected to the wonder and curiosity that drive great play experiences. I believe this creative energy would bring fresh perspectives to Hasbro's design team.
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
        I am expert-level in Figma, skilled in user research methodologies, and experienced collaborating with cross-functional teams including engineering, product, and marketing. I thrive in fast-paced environments where creativity and strategy intersect, and I am passionate about mentoring junior designers and elevating design culture. I would love the opportunity to discuss how my unique combination of consumer product design experience and hands-on creative practice can contribute to Hasbro's mission.
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
        Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of helping create magical experiences that inspire play and imagination.
    </div>

    <div class="closing">
        <div>Sincerely,</div>
