        Hiring Manager<br>
        Lenovo AI Ecosystem Team<br>
        Chicago, IL / Morrisville, NC

    <div class="salutation">Dear Hiring Manager,</div>

    <p>
        I am excited to apply for the Visual UX Designer position within Lenovo's AI Ecosystem team. The opportunity to help define intuitive, scalable design solutions across Lenovo's device ecosystem—from wearables to laptops—deeply resonates with my passion for creating cohesive multi-device experiences. With 4+ years of experience translating complex requirements into polished visual designs, I am eager to contribute to Lenovo's vision of seamless, AI-powered user experiences.
    </p>

    <p>
        At Pearl, I designed visually cohesive UX across mobile and desktop platforms, increasing user engagement by 25%. I built a cross-platform design system with 50+ Figma components that reduced design-to-dev handoff time by 40%—directly aligning with your need for scalable design systems and close engineer collaboration. My experience translating wireframes into polished visual mockups, iterating on prototypes, and preparing assets for development mirrors the core responsibilities of this role.
    </p>

    <p>
        At Booz Allen Hamilton, I led visual UX design for five federal agency products reaching 200,000+ monthly users across web and mobile. I created and maintained accessible design systems (WCAG 2.1 AA) ensuring consistency across platforms, and regularly presented design work to stakeholders and partner teams. This experience honed my ability to communicate design decisions with clarity and collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams—skills essential for Lenovo's fast-paced, entrepreneurial AI organization.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am particularly drawn to Lenovo's focus on AI and multimodal interfaces. My background includes HCI interface design at BMW Group, where I supported automotive display design using eye-tracking validation—experience that translates directly to designing intelligent, context-aware interactions across diverse form factors. I stay informed on emerging design trends in AI-driven experiences and am excited to apply this knowledge to create the next era of Lenovo products.
    </p>

    <p>
        I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my visual design expertise, cross-platform design system experience, and passion for AI-driven interfaces can contribute to the AI Ecosystem team's success. Thank you for considering my application.
